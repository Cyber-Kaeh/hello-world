<h3>A little about me</h3>

I am currently a full time student. I am going into my second year for an AAS in Computer Programming and Software Development. I just completed advanced Python programming, and I feel confident in using python for it's basic uses, like loops and functions. I also have a fair grasp of the more advanced topics like classes, threading, and importing libraries.<br>
What I didn't learn about was how to package my programs or what to do with them after writing them. I'll be starting on learning Java in the next semester and there aren't any more Python classes to take so I was left scratching my head on where to go from here to learn about packaging and finishing programs. I was told simply, get on GitHub. I still don't fully understand why or what I am supposed to be doing here but I'm still excited to be learning something new so...<br>
